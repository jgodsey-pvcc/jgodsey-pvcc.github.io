      <h1>Are We Too Dependent on Computer Applications </h1>
      <p1>Have we truly become so dependent on technology that it affects our everyday lives? Technology has grown to the point where it is used in international commerce and international communication. This in itself is not a bad thing, but problems do arise when the applications we use end up failing.</p1>

    <h2>What Happens When Technology Fails?</h2>
      
  <p>With the demanding use of technology to make our lives simpler, the critical use of it can potentially ruin our lives. Individuals who rely on Internet communication for social interaction can be put into a downhill state of mental illness when Internet servers are down, causing more extreme social anxiety and depression as this communication line is completely shut off. </p>
  
  <p>
	Another aspect to worry about when an internet server crashes, or when all servers crash, is the economic decline that will take place. Since most modern public trading indexes and financial institutions rely on modern computer technology to operate, the risk of a server crash is detrimental to global commerce. Public stockholder trades would stop temporarily causing public companies to lose large amounts of value and thus decrease the global economy until servers are put back online. Banking would also have a similar issue, computer software used to access bank information would be out of commission. Causing bankers to possibly lose money and not have access to it until FICO is able to reinsure the money that they had.
</p>
      <p> Critical infrastructure like server-based communication lines and healthcare technologies would also fail in these types of scenarios. Medical files would become inaccessible and medical machines like ventilators and other life-saving technology could become inoperable and put millions at risk. The agriculture sector of the world also has a large risk of failing when technology fails. Food processing plants could inevitably shut down and automated technologies used to maintain crops/livestock could cease operations, thus creating mass food shortages for the global population. 
  </p>
      <p> Infrastructure like dams, nuclear plants, and most military assets would also be at major risk with global technology outages. Dams would have minimal operating capacity, making access to natural resources severely limited for the public. Nuclear power plants rely on computer technology for data collection and safety. Without being able to store data on how much energy a power plant is producing, the risk of a meltdown increases, putting workers and any civilization living near the power plant at risk. Safety measures are also severely limited in this case, making the protocol to shut down a power plant uncoordinated and possibly dangerous. One of the most important sectors that would be affected is the military infrastructure. The United States heavily relies on computer technology to operate radar detection, laser-guided operating systems, and general user-operated systems. Most of the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy would have severe consequences in the event of system shutdowns, making the capabilities of the U.S. military obsolete and distorted. This, in turn, could lead to conflict with foreign powers knowing that most infrastructure is vulnerable, but at the same time, foreign nations could also face similar issues if computer technology fails. 
  </p>
      <h3>How to Overcome Technology Failure</h3>
      <p> For individual use, people should try and make an effort to limit personal technology use, to allow for normal social interactions outside of the internet. For businesses and other parts of critical infrastructure, the government should make preparations and more secure infrastructure in the event of a major solar storm in order to avoid the consequences of technology failure. While this may seem extremely difficult for the government to do with current technological advancements, applications in the near future may be able to minimize the risk of global outages and prevent the consequences that follow with it.</p>
